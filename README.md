# Hospital Management System - Oracle Database Project

This project is a Python-based Oracle Database management system for a hospital. It provides a structured schema and interactive SQL queries to manage hospital departments, patients, doctors, treatments, rooms, and more.

## Features

- **Database Schema Creation**: Tables for departments, patients, doctors, rooms, treatments, medicines, bills, and phones.
- **Sample Data Population**: Predefined records to simulate a real hospital environment.
- **Interactive Query Execution**: Allows users to select various predefined SQL queries via a command-line interface.
- **Data Retrieval and Management**: Supports insert, update, and retrieval operations with JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Oracle Database** (with a user named `system` and password `khdmdcm` running on `localhost` with SID `xe`)
- **cx_Oracle Python Library**

  Install `cx_Oracle` via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install cx_Oracle
  ```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-management-system.git
    cd hospital-management-system
    ```

2. Set up the Oracle Database:
    - Ensure you have Oracle Database installed and running on your machine.
    - Use the Oracle user `system` with password `khdmdcm` or adjust the connection details in the code as needed.

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python hospital_management_system.py
    ```

## How It Works

### Database Structure

The project creates the following tables:

- **Department**: Manages hospital departments.
- **Patient**: Stores patient details.
- **Doctor**: Stores doctor information and links to departments.
- **Room**: Details about room types and cost.
- **Treatment**: Stores treatments associated with patients and doctors.
- **Medicine**: Manages medicines prescribed for treatments.
- **Bill**: Billing details for treatments.
- **Phone**: Stores patient phone numbers.
- **Lives**: Tracks room assignment for patients.

### Running Queries

After launching the program, the main menu displays options for executing various predefined queries, such as:
1. Creating tables and inserting records.
2. Retrieving patients and their doctors.
3. Finding doctors with the most treatments.
4. Calculating total revenue generated by each doctor.
5. Finding average room cost by type.

Each query output is displayed directly in the terminal.

## Example Queries

Some example queries in the application include:

- **List all doctors and their departments**:
  ```sql
  SELECT d.Name AS DoctorName, dep.DepartmentName
  FROM Doctor d
  JOIN Department dep ON d.DepartmentID = dep.DepartmentID;
  ```

- **Calculate total revenue generated by each doctor**:
  ```sql
  SELECT d.Name AS DoctorName, SUM(t.TreatmentCost) AS TotalRevenue
  FROM Doctor d
  JOIN Treatment t ON d.DoctorID = t.DoctorID
  GROUP BY d.Name
  ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
  ```

- **Find average cost of rooms by type**:
  ```sql
  SELECT RoomType, AVG(CostPerDay) AS AverageCost
  FROM Room
  GROUP BY RoomType
  ORDER BY AverageCost DESC;
  ```

## Usage

After launching the program:
1. Choose a query option (1-15) from the main menu to run specific queries or operations.
2. The results for each query are displayed in the console.
